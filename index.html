	<h1 class=aboutyorktown id=About>About:</h1>
	<p class=aboutyorktown>
	Yorktown is a Starbase located near the Necro Cloud Nebula (Coordinates 42.562.374.1774), it was created in lieu of a Planetary base to ensure the Federation remained unbiased geographically towards all member and newly inducted worlds. The Starbase currently serves as the Federation&rsquo;s impromptu hub, outside of the core worlds (<a href="http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Earth">Earth,</a>, <a href="http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Vulcan_(planet)">Vulcan</a>, <a href="http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Tellar_Prime">Tellar Prime</a>, <a href="http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Andoria">Andoria</a>, <a href="http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Federation_members">etc.</a>) from having the remote yet advantageous position at the very edge of the Federation's western frontier. From those factors and many more, Yorktown is rated second in racial/species diversity (Fourth Quarter, 2262), just behind that of Risa.

	<p class=aboutyorktown>
	Yorktown is constructed as a sphere 300 Kilometers in diameter, with 12 large spiral arms for the city&rsquo;s buildings. Each sprial twists in a circular arc across the sphere of the base spanning approximately 30 degrees each axis, all are connected to Yorktown Headquarters and the Central Atmospheric Cycler at the point of the Yorktown Central Plaza. 50% [6/12] spirals are hollow on the inside, giving way to the Spacelanes and Shipyard of Yorktown.</p>
	<h2 class=aboutyorktown id=Living>Living in Yorktown:</h2>
	<p class=aboutyorktown>
	Life in Yorktown can be construed as quite idyllic, with the base offering the same as every Minshara-class planet in the Federation (1.0atm-1.255atm; 9.81m/s-10.245m/s gravity etc.). While offering even more in terms of infrastructure. While the twisting spirals of the Starbase may appear nauseating at first, there are many benefits that outweight the inconveniences. There are many things one may not even find on Earth, such as free public transporter booths and rail service that is on time for 99.955% of the time since its start of service in 2105.
	</p>
	<h2 class=aboutyorktown id=Starships>Starship Production/Resupply</h2>
	<p class=aboutyorktown>
	Aside from being a Starbase, Yorktown also offers unparalleled manufacturing capabilities in the Federation, being able to produce 62 Starships/year at its sustainable peak (Second Quarter, 2242). Such abilities also allow it to only keep a minimal complement (3) Starships for the purpose of defense, from the ability to constantly create and repair the network of automated defense satellites in synchronous orbit.
