	<p class=aboutyorktown>
	The Necro Cloud is a strange mix of a Nebula and an asteroid field towards the west of Yorktown (2,███,███ Kilometers) <br> Due to the copious amounts of loose rock and charged particles, ships navigating within the Necro Cloud often have sensors disrupted, <br> as such, all known data regarding the Necro Cloud has been collected using Megallen Probes
